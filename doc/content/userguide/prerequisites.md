### Required packages
- Required
  - A C++11-standard-compliant compiler
  - liblua (>= 5.1)
  - libcurl (>=7.57.0)
- Optional
  - systemd (for auto-start of the agent on boot)
  - libmodbus (>= 3.0.8) (only for the use of Modbus)
  - lua-socket (>=3.0) (only for the use of CANopen)

The packages can be installed by using a terminal and the following commands on Ubuntu 18.04.
```shell
# compiler
sudo apt install build-essential
# required
sudo apt install liblua5.3-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev
# optional for Modbus
sudo apt install libmodbus-dev lua-socket
# optional for CANopen
sudo apt install lua-socket
```

The following steps have been tested for Ubuntu 18.04, but should work with other distributions as well.
To make sure that the following libraries (-dev version) are installed:
- libcurl >= 7.57.0
- lua >= 5.1

Look to see if the libraries are installed using `apt` command. (Should be something like `libcurl4-gnutls-dev` or `liblua5.3-dev`)

```shell
apt list --installed | grep libcurl
apt list --installed | grep lua
```

In case they are not installed on your computer, search for the libraries' packages.

```shell
apt-cache search libcurl | grep dev
apt-cache search liblua | grep dev
```

Then, install the proper libraries. For example:

```shell
sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
sudo apt install liblua5.3-dev
```

### Building the Cumulocity C++ SDK
The agent software requires the [**Cumulocity C++ SDK**](https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-sdk-c/src/master/).
Before starting to build the software, you need to build the Cumulocity C++ SDK.

1. Launch Git client and clone the SDK repository to a directory where you want. For example,
    ```shell
    cd ~/<my_working_directory>
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/m2m/cumulocity-sdk-c.git
    ```

2. Enter the directory and pull in all submodule dependencies.
    ```shell
    cd cumulocity-sdk-c
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

3. From inside the _cumulocity-sdk-c_ directory, create _init.mk_ file by copying _common.mk_.
    ```shell
    cp common.mk init.mk
    ```
    Also, create a custom _Makefile_ by copying _Makefile.template_.
    ```shell
    cp Makefile.template Makefile
    ```

4. Modify your _init.mk_ file with the proper library name on the `CPPFLAGS` and `LDLIBS` line. If you installed the `liblua5.3-dev` then modify
    from:
    ```shell
    CPPFLAGS:=$(shell pkg-config --cflags libcurl lua)
    CXXFLAGS:=-Wall -pedantic -Wextra
    LDLIBS:=$(shell pkg-config --libs libcurl lua)
    ```
    to:
    ```shell
    CPPFLAGS:=$(shell pkg-config --cflags libcurl lua5.3)
    CXXFLAGS:=-Wall -pedantic -Wextra
    LDLIBS:=$(shell pkg-config --libs libcurl lua5.3)
    ```

    If you don't know which liblua version has already installed in your device,
    you can also find the version which you need to add to your _init.mk_ by:
    ```shell
    ldconfig -p | grep lua
    ```
    It will return some names like "liblua**5.3**.so.0", so you can know lua5.3 should be added.

5. To build the SDK in debug mode, run:
    ```shell
    make
    ```
    For production, to build in release mode, run:
    ```shell
    make release
    ```
    To remove all intermediate build files, run:
    ```shell
    make clean
    ```
